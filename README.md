# Practice Git Security
This repo is a quick tutorial on how to scan a repo for secrets, remove them from history, and prevent leaking of secrets. Go through these steps chronologically. 

Any step that has "(no action)" at the end indicates that no action is required before moving to the next step of the tutorial.

## Git Leaks

1. Fork this repo. If you simply clone instead, you won't be able to push the changes you make.
2. We're going to scan our repo with `gitLeaks` (though there are [many options](https://spectralops.io/blog/top-9-git-secret-scanning-tools/)). Follow the directions [here](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) to install it.
3. Make sure that you follow the instructions to [install](https://pre-commit.com/#install) `pre-commit` (`pip install pre-commit` or `brew install pre-commit`) and run `pre-commit autoupdate`
4. In a terminal, navigate to the base of the repo `cd /path/to/this/repo`. 
5. Run `pre-commit install`. This will install the `gitLeaks` hook, because we have it specified in the file `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
6. Think about what we want to catch. GitLeaks has an impressive list of [rules](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/blob/master/config/gitleaks.toml) that it uses to identify data it strongly suspects are secrets. It will catch secrets that follow the format of common secrets like AWS secret keys and GCP API keys, or even obscure secrets like "Etsy Access Tokens." You can also add custom formats. (no action)
7. We could run a check right now against the default rules, but we will add one rule first to catch when a file contains the exact string `PASSWORD=` followed by anything. At the root of this repo, create a file called `.gitleaks.toml` with the following content:
```pre
title = "Gitleaks Custom Rules"

[extend]
useDefault = true

[[rules]]
id = "exclude PASSWORD="
description = "checks for instances of PASSWORD= followed by digits"
regex = '''PASSWORD=.*'''

[allowlist]
description = "allow README, for examples"
paths = [
    '''README.md'''
]
```

8. Now, with our default and custom rules set up, let's test that we can't commit something bad. Create a file called `password.txt` with the following content:
```AWS_KEY=AKIAIMNOJVGFDXXXE4OA```
9. Add the file `git add password.txt`
10. Commit it: `git commit -m "uh oh, secret here"`. If you get an error, congratulations! You've blocked yourself from committing a secret!
11. Yeah, let's just delete that `password.txt`. We don't want that anymore.
12. Let's direct our attention to the repo and our history. If you look at our current files, we don't see anything that raises concern. It's just this `README.md`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, a `docs` folder with images, and a `.gitleaks.toml` you created. But anything can happen in our history. (no action)
13. Run `git log --pretty=format:"%h%x09%an%x09%ad%x09%s"` (You can also run `git log`, but this will just be longer output, and we want something short and pretty). It should look something like the following, perhaps longer:
```

```
14. Nothing suspicious there, right? Just kidding. A couple of those commits may contain a secret. We will use the `detect` command: `gitleaks detect`. It should give us a warning ("WRN"):
```
WRN leaks found: 3
```
15. Re-run, this time with the `-v` flag for a verbose output: `gitleaks detect -v`
16. Did you get an error for the `bad.env` file? It has broken our custom rule, as well as one of the default rules--but it is useful to note we only see the first (custom) rule listed in the warning. Expected output should look something like the following:
![Error using gitleaks](docs/error_gitleaks.png)
17. What's next? Removing that secret that some bumbling idiot committed!!

## Removing Sensitive Information: BFG
*Note: `bfg` may not remove all instances of a secret. For instance, you're removing it from your fork of my repo, but the secret it still in mine! Be cognizant of this when using this in the real world*

These instructions closely follow those posted [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository) by GitHub.
1. Install [bfg](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/). On MacOS: `brew install bfg`.
2. Navigate to our repo root `cd /path/to/this/repo` (you're probably already there)
3. Identify the file we want to filter OUT: `bad.env`. We can either remove this file completely (using the `--delete-files` flag) or replace all the text of particular files (using the `--replace-text` flag). We will remove `bad.env` completely.
4. In this case, we will check our history for the commit(s) that we expect to filter OUT: `git log --pretty=format:"%h%x09%an%x09%ad%x09%s"`. The descriptions of the two commits are `not suspicious` and  `not suspicious 2023`. We expect not to see these commit after the filter since they only involve adding or modifying `bad.env`.
4. Now for the powerful function: `bfg --delete-files bad.env` (*this is an intense function, double-check that your command is correct before running*)
5. Once we run this, let's make sure that the logs look correct. If we run `git log --pretty=format:"%h%x09%an%x09%ad%x09%s"`, most of the history should be the same, with the notable exception of our `not suspicious` and `not suspicious 2023` commits. If you look closely at our history, `bad.env` is gone!
6. Let's run `gitleaks detect` to make sure. It should pass.
7. Now that we're sure that we're good. Let's run `git push --force`. This will update the remote repository. We're all fixed!

## Preventative Measures
That's nerve-wracking, and can be a bit of work! How can we just prevent these things from happening? There are many ways. Some of the most effective ways to prevent leaking of secrets is to not have them in the repository at all: 

1. put secrets in a location outside of the repo,
2. use environment variables to export secrets, and then read them from those variables in the code, or 
3. use a secrets management system. 

But for this small demonstration, let's say you want a `.env` file in your repo:

1. Let's prevent that specific case of secret-committing from happening. Create a `.gitignore` with the contents, which will ignore any file with the `.env` extension:
```
*.env
```
2. Actually, we can do even better than that. GitHub maintains a list of `.gitignore` templates for dozens of languages [here](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main). Let's just choose the Python one [here](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore). Copy the contents of that into our `.gitignore` 
3. Create a file called `bad.env`. Run `git status`. Notice how that file doesn't even show up? The power of `.gitignore`. You're safe, *as long as the `.gitignore` ignores this file!

## Do Even Better: SeCureLI

The [seCureLI](https://github.com/slalombuild/secureli) open source project that not only scans your local repo for secrets before you commit code to a remote repository like gitLeaks, but also installs linters based on the code of your project to support security and coding best practices, and configures all the hooks needed so you donâ€™t have to. It collects valuable tools based on the type of project you're working on.
